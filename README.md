List of Implementations
    1) Trees
        binary_tree.py :
    
        This program is for creating of binary search tree and implementation of its basic and auxiliary operations
        Basic Operations:
        1) Insert an element into a tree
        2) Searching for an element
        3) Deletion of an element
        4) Find Maximum element in the tree
        5) Find Minimum element in the tree
        6) Level ordered printing of tree
        7) Depth First Inordered printing of tree
        8) Check if tree is Binary Search Tree or not
        9) Find Successor of an element in binary search tree
        
To run program you need to install python3, Python 3.5.2 is the version i have used while writing the following code.
